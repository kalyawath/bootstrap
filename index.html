  <h2>My Favorite Van Gogh Artwork Example</h2>
  <p>The Starry Night:</p>
  <p>Description:This painting was created while Van Gogh was staying in the Saint-Rémy psychiatric hospital. The swirling, dynamic sky represents the turbulent and powerful emotional state he was experiencing.</p>
  <p>The tall tree in the foreground is a cypress, which is often used as a symbol of death and the journey to heaven.</p>
